# Motivation
There are two main motivations to making this game:
*  To make a playable game in Unity3D. Before this, while I could use Unity3D
to create demos, I have not created a proper game. 
* To create a game that has some form of procedural generation.

# Technologies and languages Used
* Unity3D
* C# (for Unity3D and Level Generation program)
